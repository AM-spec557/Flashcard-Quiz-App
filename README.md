The Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub actions 
What is GitHub? (“GitHub Diversity.” 2021) 
GitHub is a version control system, that is used to make collaborations for projects, uploading of repositories, and managing branches. It is an opening source that contains important information, that many tend to use for review or code. This is an open platform allowing developers to share content and use of projects for guiding purposes. It provides very useful bug tracking, task management and continuous integration for project use. GitHub comes with many designs that can be used to cooperate system considerations and a wide range of project task management, into making the outcomes look better and well improved for full operation.  

What is a yml file and why do we use it? (“yml” 2023) 
A yml file is the human readable data serialization language, that complies to creation of programming language and designing for the use of interaction among developers. It brings about flexibility and accessibility for the acknowledgement of human mindset. It implements modern programming and variety of files. This is a persistence, internet messaging, and cross language data sharing. This produces the use of productivity in development of an operational system. It is often used for configuration, programming or framework. The common uses are configuration management, infrastructure as code and data serialization.
